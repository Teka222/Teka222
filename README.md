🌍 **About Me**
---

I'm a passionate front-end developer and an ALX Software Engineering learner currently on the **Pro Dev Front-End track**. My journey into tech began with curiosity and a desire to understand how the web works — not just visually, but functionally.

💡 What truly inspires me is the potential of technology to improve lives. I'm especially interested in building solutions that support **mental health and well-being**.

🎯 **My Vision:**  
To create digital tools that make mental health support more accessible, starting with a simple, user-friendly mental wellness app.
